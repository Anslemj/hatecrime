<p> Data from the United States Department of Justice shows that from 2018 to 2020 in the United States, there has been an increase in hate crimes. One group that faced a lot of hate crimes in 2020 is Asians during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, hate crimes against Asians rose 73% in 2020. There were  279 reported hate crimes against Asians in 2020 versus the 161 reported hate crimes against Asians in 2019. There was also a large bias in the media showing African Americans conducting hate crimes against Asians as the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that white people made up more than 55 percent of offenders hate crimes against Asians in the US.
</p>
<p> Another group of people that faced hate crimes during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were people of color, especially black people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that black people had the largest rise in hate crimes in 2020. 1,972 black people reported hate crimes in 2019, and 2,755 black people reported hate crimes in 2020. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Phyllis Gerstenfeld, Professor in the Criminal Justice Department at California State University Stanislaus, studies hate crimes in the US. “There are several possible reasons why there is an increase in hate crimes in some states more than others. One, there may have been more hate crimes in those places, maybe due to events that occurred there or due to activity by organized hate groups. Two, hate crime reporting rates are very low. People in those states may have become more likely to report, maybe because they're more aware of the issues. Three, police agencies in those states may have improved their reporting rates. This could be due to increased training, more focus on hate crime by agencies, increased use of bias crime units, pressure from media or other outside forces, or other reasons,” Dr.Gerstenfeld said.</p>
<p>The map below shows hate crimes that were reported in 2018 and 2020 in the US. The map also shows how much of an increase or decrease each state had in hate crimes. These crimes were committed against persons, properties, and societies. Also, these hate crimes were motivated by race/ethnicity/ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity. </p>
